# RNAseq Assets

Primarily a storehouse of bash scripts related to processing RNAseq files on Ubuntu.


## Why is this useful?
- Setting up many of these softwares is a pain on other systems (e.g. dependency issues) or is just sometimes incompatible with those systems
- Some of these softwares require too much memory (e.g. STAR) and should be run on the cloud anyway
- The dockerfiles enable us to quickly set up an Ubuntu instance with full capability for RNAseq processing
